# bilibili-captcha

## Overview

The Python program attempts to recognize [CAPTCHA images](http://www.bilibili.com/captcha) generated by [bilibili.com](http://www.bilibili.com/).

The Python program is developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.10.4 and Windows 10 using python 3.4, and there might be
problems if the program is run under other environments. Particularly, the program will not compile using python
2 because of the differences in syntax.

## Dependencies

## Usage

Clone all the files and put them under the same directory as your program, including the dataset folder.

## Key Files Overview

captcha_provider.py:

This module is designed to represent the source of the captcha. An abstract base class (HttpCaptchaProvider) is 
defined to represent abstract captcha providers and a derived class (BilibiliCaptchaProvider) is defined to 
represent the specific captcha source we are attempting to recognize. If you want to define other captcha 
sources, you can define another class that inherits the abstract base class. Two methods thar must be
overridden are _get_data_from_seq and _is_correct_response. They represent getting the data that needs to be
submitted as part of the request to verify and checking whether the recognized sequence is true, respectively.

captcha_recognizer.py:

This module is designed to recognize the images (the return of imread function in matplotlib.image) from a 
particular captcha source (derived class of HttpCaptchaProvider). The steps to recognize an image are

1. Noise reduction 

  1.1 Noise reduction by hsv

  1.2 Noise reduction by neighbors

After this step the remaining image is a greyscale image with slight noise.

2. Segmentation
Components are found using the next-nearest-neighbor.

After this step the image is partitioned into a number of "characters".

3. Recognition
If the partitioned characters is as desired, each is recognized using the model in captcha_learn.py.


captcha_learn.py:

This module is designed to use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to learn to recognize individual captcha character.
The input layer consists of 300 neurons, which is the result of flattening the standard 20 by 15 captcha character image.
There is only one hidden layer, and it consists of 200 hidden neurons.
The output layer consists of 26 neurons, each corresponding to one possible outcome (EFGH JKLMN PQR TUVWXY  123456 89).
The activation function used is tanh.
There is already a model with tuned parameters, and it is saved in best_model.pkl.
If you want to reconstruct the model, call reconstruct_model method.
If you want to make prediction, call predict method.

## Example

Let's take a look at a few examples.

Suppose we want to recognize a bilibili captcha image called img (the return of imread in matplotlib.image), we can

    import time

    import config as c
    import dataset_manager
    from captcha_recognizer import CaptchaRecognizer
    from captcha_provider import BilibiliCaptchaProvider
    from helper import show_image, time_func
    import captcha_learn
    
    provider = BilibiliCaptchaProvider()
    recognizer = CaptchaRecognizer()
    success, seq, weak_confidence = recognizer.recognize(img, save_intermediate=True, verbose=True,reconstruct=False, force_partition=False)

For the parameters,
the parameter save_intermediate controls whether intermediate materials are saved.
If set to true, we can find those materials under /temp.
The parameter verbose controls whether additional information like timing is printed out.
The parameter reconstruct controls whether we need to reconstruct the learning model.
The force_partition controls whether the recognizer recognizes those images that are partitioned into four pieces.
This parameter is designed to be used in case under which we want to maximize our chance of success when we cannot
overlook the number of times the partition fails. However, in real world situations,
it is usually the case that we can regenerate captcha as many times as we want so we do not have to worry about the number of times the partition fails.

For the return values,
success is a boolean variable indicating whether the recognition is successful.
Seq is the recognized sequence if the recognition is successful.
Weak_confidence is a boolean variable indicating whether we are only weakly confident about the partition.
It is not relevant here because the variable force_partition is set to be false.

Now suppose we want to test whether a captcha fetched from bilibili.com is correct for n times, we can

    import time

    import config as c
    import dataset_manager
    from captcha_recognizer import CaptchaRecognizer
    from captcha_provider import BilibiliCaptchaProvider
    from helper import show_image, time_func
    import captcha_learn

    test_recognize_http(num=n)

For an explanation of output, see section "Benchmark" below.   


## Benchmark

The function test_recognize_http which tests recognizing the captcha characters from bilibili.com is run 1000 times
(test_recognize_http(num=1000)) on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and the result is as follows:

Fail:  233

Right weak:  78

Right strong:  412

Right total:  490

Wrong weak:  260

Wrong strong:  17

Wrong total:  277

Total success rate:  0.49

Success rate when confident:  0.6388526727509778

Success rate when strongly confident:  0.9603729603729604

Success rate when weakly confident:  0.23076923076923078

Time used to test recognize http is:  350.77492213249207

According to the result, we can see that the total success rate is 49%, which means that 490 out of 1000 captchas are
recognized successfully. However, we also notice that when the model is strongly confident of the result, which means the
image is successfully partitioned into five characters (the length of the captcha generate by bilibili.com),
the success rate is approximately 96%. Therefore, in actual situations, one probably would not care so much about
the total success rate, because one could always ask to regenerate the captcha if not strongly confident,
and thus the success rate would be nearly 100%.
