# bilibili-captcha
===============================

# Overview

The Python program attempts to recognize [CAPTCHA images](http://www.bilibili.com/captcha) generated by [bilibili.com](http://www.bilibili.com/).

The Python program is developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.10.4 and Windows 10 using python 3.4, there might be
problems if the program is run under other environments. Particularly, the program will not compile using python
2 because of the differences in syntax.

# Dependencies

- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/)
- [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable)
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org)

# Usage

Clone all the files and put them under the same directory as your program, including the dataset folder.

# Key Files Overview

captcha_provider.py:

This module is designed to represent the source of the captcha. An abstract base class (HttpCaptchaProvider) is 
defined to represent abstract captcha providers and a derived class (BilibiliCaptchaProvider) is defined to 
represent the specific captcha source we are attempting to recognize. If you want to define other captcha 
sources, you can define another class that inherits from the abstract base class. Two methods thar must be 
overridden are _get_data_from_seq and _is_correct_response which represents getting the data that needs to be 
submitted as part of the request to verify and checking whether the recognized sequence is true respectively.

captcha_recognizer.py:

This module is designed to recognize the images (the return of imread function in matplotlib.image) from a 
particular captcha source (derived class of HttpCaptchaProvider). The steps that an image is recognized are

1. Noise reduction 
  1.1 Noise reduction by hsv
  1.2 Noise reduction by neighbors
After this step the remaining image is a greyscale image with slight nosie.
2. Segmentation
Components are found using the next-nearest-neightbor.
After this step the image is partioned into a number of "characters"."
3. Recognition
If the partitioned characters is as desired, each is recognized using the model in captcha_learn.py.
